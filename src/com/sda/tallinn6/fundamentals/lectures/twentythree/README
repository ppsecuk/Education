Teach HashMap and HashSet.



    A HashMap cannot contain duplicate keys.

    Java HashMap allows null values and the null key.

    HashMap is an unordered collection. It does not guarantee any specific order of the elements.

    Java HashMap is not thread-safe. You must explicitly synchronize concurrent modifications to the HashMap.



HashSet cannot contain duplicate values.

HashSet allows null value.

HashSet is an unordered collection. It does not maintain the order in which the elements are inserted.
