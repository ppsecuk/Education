        // Java defines several bitwise bitshift operators,
        // which can be applied to the integer types, long, int, short, char, and byte.
        // The operators discussed in this section are less commonly used.
        // Therefore, their coverage is brief; the intent is to simply
        // make you aware that these operators exist.


        // a = 60 b = 13

        // & (bitwise and) : Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
        // (a & b) will give 12 which is 0000 1100
        System.out.println("a&b :" + (a&b));

        // | (bitwise or) : Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
        // (a | b) will give 61 which is 0011 1101
        System.out.println("a | b :" + (a | b));


        // ^ (bitwise xor) : Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
        //  a bitwise operator compares each bit in a number
        //  and returns 0 if the numbers are the same,
        //  and returns 1 if they arenâ€™t the same.

        // ~ (bitwise complement) : Binary Ones Complement Operator
        // is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
        // (~a ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011
        // in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.

        // The right shift operator >> will add the sign bit (1 in case of negative numbers,
        // and 0 in case of positive numbers or zero) on the left side while the other (>>>) will always add zeros.
